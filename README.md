The All the schemes.f95 solves the transportation of the property Ï• by convection and diffusion means in one-dimensional space. The domain is first discretized into ten control volumes and then the governing equation is linearized using the Central Differential Scheme, Upwind Differential Scheme and Power Law Differential Scheme. A promp window will ask which scheme to use. The code was written using the IDE Netbeans. Nevertheless, the code can be compiled using other platforms.
